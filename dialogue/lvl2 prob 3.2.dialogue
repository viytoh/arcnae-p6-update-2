After determining the velocity of the stick, what is the angle of the stick's velocity relative to due north? [i](Choose the angle that ensures the stickâ€™s resultant motion is due north despite the wind blowing west.)
- 28.1 degrees W of N.
	That was the correct angle!
- 28.1 degrees N of W.
	That was slightly wrong.
	=> start
- 27.6 W of N.
	You miscalculated the angle. I suggest you try again.
