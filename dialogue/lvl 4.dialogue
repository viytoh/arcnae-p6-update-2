[i]On his way home from his last quest, Totoy felt an ominous tremor beneath his feet—a dark, suffocating energy that rivaled anything he had faced before. Drawn to an eerie dungeon that suddenly appeared, he ventured inside. 

[i]The walls pulsed with a sinister life, leading him to a vast chamber lit by ghostly blue flames. At its center stood a towering figure, clad in rusted, blood-streaked armor and radiating unimaginable power. His molten eyes locked onto Totoy with murderous intent, and the air thickened with the promise of battle.

[i]*unknown enemy appears*
[wave]???: "So, you’re the so-called prodigy wizard. The one who’s been toying with my underlings with those twisted spells of yours?"
Totoy: "Your ‘men’ attacked me first. If anything, you should thank me for sparing them. Ever heard of self-defense?"
[i]The Mob Boss’s laugh echoed through the chamber, harsh and mocking.
???: [b]"Spare me your pathetic justifications! You’ve trespassed where you don’t belong. Now, you’ll pay for your meddling. Show me your strength—if you dare!"
[i][shake]The dungeon quaked violently as dark energy swirled around the Mob Boss, his power suffocating the very air.
???: [shake][b] "EXCUSES!!! Enough talk. Let’s see if you’re worthy of leaving here alive!"
