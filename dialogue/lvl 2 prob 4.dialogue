The 3 remaining mobs try to escape through a wagon moving with a velocity of 63.5 m/s at 32 degrees south of east. Calculate the wagonâ€™s horizontal and vertical velocity components. 
[i]Tip: SohCahToa!
- 54.5 m/s, E & 33.64/2, S  
	Wrong calculation! Try again.
	=> start
- 53.85 m/s, E & 33.64 m/s, S
	Correct! 
- 33.60 m/s E
	Close! But you still missed.
	That was a bit far!
