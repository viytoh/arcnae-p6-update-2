Totoy: Ugh... my head’s killing me. What the—!? Where am I? What happened?

Totoy: All I can remember is my name... and this weird flash of a memory. Back on Earth, I was some kind of physics genius. If that’s true, I need to figure out a way back home.
He notices a wooden sword on his hand.

Random shaking for intense and ominous atmosphere. Mobs suddenly appear and attack Totoy as he collects his thoughts. 
Totoy: I need to finish them off before it's too late.
